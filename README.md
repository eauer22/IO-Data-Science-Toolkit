# IO-Data-Science-Toolkit
In this SIOP 2021 tutorial, we demonstrate data science principles and tools that are important for the contemporary IO. We will discuss key information and steps associated with getting started with R and Python, code development and collaboration tools, tools for sharing outputs and results (applications, reports, and dashboards), and other helpful tools including SQL and command line.
